## Overview

### The challenge

This is a solution to the IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- API's ( IPify, LeafletJS)
