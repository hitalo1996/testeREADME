## Overview

### Result
[//]: # "This is a solution to the IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor."

Under development...

### The challenge

The challenge is to build this IP Address Tracker app and make it look as close to the design as possible:

 <img src="desktop-design.jpg" alt="Application demo" />
 <img src="mobile-design.jpg" alt="Application demo" />
</p>

To get the IP address locations, the IPify IP Geolocation API will be used. And to generate the map, the LeafletJS API

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on your device's screen size
- View focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- View your own IP address on the map at home page load
- Search any IP addresses or domains and view key information and location
